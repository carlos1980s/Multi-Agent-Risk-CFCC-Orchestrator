        "Overview\n",
        "The system is designed to help financial institutions navigate complex risk and compliance challenges by distributing queries to specialized agents. The framework includes five specialized agents:\n",
        "\n",
        "Regulatory & Compliance Agent: Provides guidance on international regulations (e.g., Basel III, GDPR, AML).\n",
        "Financial Crime & Fraud Agent: Focuses on anti‑money laundering (AML), KYC, sanctions screening, and fraud detection.\n",
        "Operational Risk & Internal Control Agent: Assesses internal process failures and suggests improvements for operational resilience.\n",
        "Cyber Risk Agent: Analyzes IT and cybersecurity threats, recommending strategies to fortify digital defenses.\n",
        "Strategic & Emerging Risk Agent: Evaluates broader market, credit, liquidity, and ESG risks, offering strategic recommendations.\n",
        "An orchestrator agent uses an enhanced selection criteria—based on keyword and context analysis—to determine which specialized agent should handle each user query.\n",
        "\n",
        "The user interface is built with Gradio and features two tabs:\n",
        "\n",
        "Configuration Tab: Allows users to review and modify the default system prompts for each agent and set the overall selection criteria.\n",
        "Query Execution Tab: Users can enter their queries; the orchestrator selects the appropriate agent and returns both the agent name and its response.\n",
        "Features\n",
        "Multi-Agent Architecture: Supports five distinct domains of risk & CFCC expertise.\n",
        "Dynamic Orchestration: Utilizes an orchestrator agent that analyzes query content and selects the best matching agent based on the defined selection criteria.\n",
        "Configurable UI: Built using Gradio Blocks to separate configuration from query execution.\n",
        "Default Configuration: Comes with realistic system prompts and selection criteria that reflect current industry practices.\n",
        "Extensible: Easily update or add additional agents and modify prompts as regulatory environments evolve.\n",
        "Installation\n",
        "Clone the Repository:\n",
        "\n",

        "Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then run:\n",
        "\n",
        "bash\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",

        "Modify the overall selection criteria as needed.\n",
        "Click the \"Save Configuration\" button to store your settings.\n",
        "Query Execution Tab:\n",
        "Enter a risk or compliance query (e.g., \"How do I assess the impact of recent regulatory changes on our operational risk framework?\").\n",
        "Click \"Submit Query\" to have the orchestrator analyze your query and choose the appropriate agent.\n",

        "Regulatory & Compliance Agent Prompt:\n",
        "\"You are a senior regulatory and compliance expert for a global bank. Your role is to interpret complex international regulations—such as Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, and regional AML laws—and translate them into actionable internal policies. When addressing queries, provide clear, step-by-step guidance, reference relevant legal frameworks, and highlight any recent enforcement trends or regulatory updates. Your answer should help decision-makers understand the precise compliance actions required and potential implications for the bank.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Financial Crime & Fraud Agent Prompt:\n",
        "\"You are an experienced financial crime specialist at a leading global bank. Your expertise covers anti-money laundering, Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, sanctions screening, and fraud detection. When answering queries, break down the methods to identify suspicious activities, suggest risk-mitigation techniques, and reference best practices or case studies from industry incidents. Your recommendations should include practical steps to tighten controls against financial crime and reduce reputational risk.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Operational Risk & Internal Control Agent Prompt:\n",
        "\"You are an operational risk and internal control authority for a global bank. Your task is to evaluate and improve internal processes, detect weaknesses in operational workflows, and suggest improvements to control systems. Provide detailed, step-by-step analysis of operational risks—including human, process, and technology factors—and offer actionable strategies to optimize controls and ensure operational resilience under both normal and stressed conditions.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Cyber Risk Agent Prompt:\n",
        "\"You are a cybersecurity and digital risk expert serving a global bank. Your focus is on identifying and mitigating threats related to IT systems, cyberattacks, and data breaches. When answering questions, provide a structured analysis of vulnerabilities, reference current threat intelligence and industry best practices, and suggest actionable measures to bolster cyber defenses. Ensure your response considers both immediate fixes and a long-term cybersecurity strategy in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Strategic & Emerging Risk Agent Prompt:\n",
        "\"You are a strategic risk advisor for a global bank, with expertise in market, credit, liquidity, and ESG risks. Your role is to assess broader, emerging risks and provide guidance on aligning risk management strategies with the bank’s long-term objectives. When addressing queries, analyze both quantitative data and qualitative factors, propose stress tests or scenario analyses, and offer clear recommendations on how to integrate these risks into the bank’s overall risk framework. Your answer should support proactive planning and strategic decision-making.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall Selection Criteria:\n",
        "\"Analyze the user's query to determine the dominant risk theme. If the query includes regulation-specific terms (e.g., 'Basel', 'AML', 'GDPR'), select the Regulatory & Compliance Agent. If it mentions fraud, money laundering, or KYC failures, select the Financial Crime & Fraud Agent. If it addresses internal process failures, system vulnerabilities, or operational inefficiencies, select the Operational Risk & Internal Control Agent. If the query involves IT, cybersecurity, or digital transformation issues, select the Cyber Risk Agent. If it focuses on market conditions, credit or liquidity concerns, or emerging trends (including ESG), choose the Strategic & Emerging Risk Agent. Prioritize the agent whose expertise best mitigates the query’s highest-impact risk, considering both immediate and long-term implications.\"\n",
